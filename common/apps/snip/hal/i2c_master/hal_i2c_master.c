 * WICED sample application for I2C Master usage
 *
 * This application demonstrates how to use I2C driver interface
 * to send and receive bytes or a stream of bytes over the I2C hardware as a master.
 * The on-board LSM9DS1 motion sensor acts as the I2C slave
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 * - I2C WICED APIs
 *
 * This I2C Master sample application is developed for Arduino compatible development kits supported by Wiced.
 * The SCL and SDA pins are configured to Px pins during boot-up process and routed to the corresponding Arduino headers.
 * Please follow the Kit User Guide(Hardware User Manual) of the particular development kit for more pin details.
 * The development kits supported by Wiced does not require any fly wiring.
 *
 * Usage
 *
 * Program a kit with the i2c_master app. Power on the kit.
 * You can see the logs through PUART. The power supply on the kit should be 3.3V
